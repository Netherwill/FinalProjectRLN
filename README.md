# FinalProjectRLN
final project for android development class
This is the final project
For the final project, we are trying to make a "helper" app with the following functions:
1) Create a Help ticket
2) View others' Help tickets
The theory behind this app is to make people help and get help quickly, just a few seconds and you can find people you can help/make your own help request
Milestone 1: simple UI put out
